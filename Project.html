    <p>By the road,where flowers bloom,and trees stand tall, I walk with awe <br>and love it all.The sweet scentof
      blooms so fair,the lush leavesthat dance in air.<br>The road aheadI cannot see,but 'round each bend is
      beauty
      free. The journey on I'll take with glee,'til flowers fade and leaves fall free.The road ahead,<br>
      I'll travel still, with flowers bright
      and leaves fall to the ground,the memories I've made today, will always be around.I'll carry them within
      my<br>
      heart,
      a treasure to behold,to cherish when we're far apart, when seasons come and go.And as I walk this road of
      life,<br>
      I'll take each step with grace,knowing that each moment's rife with beauty, love, and faith.
      I'll keep these memories close to me,as seasons come and go,</p>

    <h2>Recipe For Chicken Pot Pie</h2>
    <p> You'll need chicken, vegetables like carrots and peas, and some herbs like thyme and rosemary.<br>
      You'll
      also
      need a few pantry staples like flour, butter, and chicken broth.</p>
    <p> First, you'll need to preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Then, you'll need to cook your chicken in a
      skillet<br>
      until it's browned on all sides. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet and set it
      aside.<br>
      Then, you'll need to cook your vegetables in the same skillet until they're tender. After the
      vegetables
      are<br>
      cooked, you'll need to add the chicken back to the skillet, along with the chicken broth, flour, and
      herbs.
      Stir the mixture until it's thickened, and then pour it into a pie dish.</p>
    <p>Now, you'll need to make the crust! You can either use a store-bought crust, or you can make your
      own.<br> If
      you're making your own crust, you'll need to combine flour, salt, and butter in a bowl.<br> Then,
      you'll
      need to
      add cold water and mix until the dough comes together. Once the dough is ready, you'll need to roll
      it out
      <br>
      and place it over the top of the pie dish. Finally, you'll need to bake the pie for about 30
      minutes, or
      <br>
      until the crust is golden brown. And that's it! You'll have a delicious chicken pot pie.
