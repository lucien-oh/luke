            <h1 class="text-wrap">I'm a Web Designer Who Helps Businesses<br>Reach Their Target Audience Online</h1>
              <p class="text-wrap">Hi, my name is Siela Lucien Noumboum and I'm new to the tech field.<br>
                  I'm passionate about learning new skills and exploring the possibilities of technology.<br>
                  I'm particularly interested in <b> Web Designing</b>, and I'm currently working on a project that uses Html
                  And
                  Css concept.<br>
                  I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the tech field, and I'm always open to new opportunities and
                  challenges.</p>
      
              <p>So, Web Desinging Has Always Been A Dream To Me From Childhood But At That Time I Had Not Come To The
                  Understanding Of The Specificity Of The Job.<br>
                  At That Time I only Knew It As Engineering. Gradually,I understood The Heterogeneous classes of the
                  Engineering
                  Field. <br>
                  Although, The Dream Was Still There, Things Changed: I Started Seeing Myself In The Health Domain. After, My
                  Advanced Level,<br>
                  My Uncle Discussed With Me About The Field And Found out I Was Interested In The Field.
                  Arrangements Were Made And I Found Myself Studying Engineering </p>
      
              <p>I'm a fast learner and a problem solver, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and expand
                  my
                  knowledge.<br>
                  In my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and trends, and I'm always open to discussing new
                  ideas
                  and opportunities.<br>
                  I'm excited to continue my journey in the tech field, and I'm looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
      
              <p>As a web designer, I'm fascinated by the way technology can be used to create visually appealing and
                  user-friendly websites.<br>
                  I love experimenting with new design trends and finding ways to make websites more intuitive and
                  engaging.<br>
                  I'm also interested in how web design can be used to tell stories and communicate ideas.<br>
                  I'm constantly learning about new tools and techniques to improve my skills and stay up to date with the
                  latest
                  developments in web design."</p>
      
      
      
              <p>Though I've never worked in a traditional office setting, I've always been a self-motivated learner.<br>
                  I'm constantly seeking out new information and resources to expand my knowledge and improve my skills.<br>
                  Even though I'm just getting started in the tech field, I'm already passionate about web design and eager to
                  learn as much as I can.<br> Despite my lack of experience, I'm confident that my motivation and drive will
                  help me succeed."</p>
      
              <p>As a web designer, I like to approach projects with a creative and collaborative mindset.<br> I'm always open
                  to
                  new ideas and willing to experiment with different approaches.<br> I also value communication and teamwork,
                  and
                  I enjoy working with others to create the best possible product.<br> Even though I work from home, I'm
                  always
                  available to collaborate and bounce ideas off of others.<br> My focus is always on delivering the best
                  possible
                  product for my clients.</p>
      
              <p>As a Christian, my faith is an important part of who I am and how I approach my work.<br> I believe that my
                  relationship with God helps me to be a better web designer, and I strive to incorporate my values into my
                  work.<br> In my personal life, I'm single and not married. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends,
                  and
                  I find fulfillment in building meaningful relationships and serving my community.</p>
